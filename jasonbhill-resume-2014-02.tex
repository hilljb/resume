\textit{Modular Infinite Storage -- Data Path Team}

\begin{itemize} \item Led development of SCSI Enclosure Services (SES) backend [C/Cython] and
frontend [Python] environmental monitoring utilities for the Modular Infinite Storage scale-out
storage and compute platform.

\item Wrote Massive Array Idle Disk (MAID) drive power [C] and udev/sysfs hardware utility
[C++/Cython] libraries for the Infinite Storage Gateway platform.

\item In charge of data path related system event logging for notification and system management.
Wrote syslog event service [C++/Boost] and led event definition and cataloging management.

\item Various: researched random IO cache algorithms for SSD/NVDIMM cache, automated target iSCSI
port and Infiniband setup in OpenSUSE/SLES, tested Linux-HA solutions (e.g., Datera/RTSos, SLES HA,
Pacemaker/Corosync).  \end{itemize}

\textbf{Ph.D. Mathematics (ABD)} -- computational group \& graph theory\hfill University
of Colorado Boulder

Working under Keith Kearnes and Alexander Hulpke to develop and implement parallel partition
backtrack algorithms for graph isomorphism generalizations on large degree permutation
representations.

\bigbreak \textbf{M.A. Mathematics (2010)} -- computational group theory, representation
theory\hfill University of Colorado Boulder

\bigbreak \textbf{M.S. Mathematics (2006)} -- computational number theory\hfill University of
Vermont

Developed and implemented an algorithm to locate an instance of the smallest absolute value
discriminant totally real number field of prime degree satisfying a given property. Used this
algorithm to discover the first known totally real quintic number field having minimal signature
group rank.
